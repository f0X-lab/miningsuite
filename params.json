{"name":"Miningsuite","tagline":"A comprehensive Matlab framework for signal, audio and music analysis, articulating audio and symbolic approaches","body":"## What is the _MiningSuite_?\r\n\r\n_MiningSuite_ is a comprehensive Matlab framework for signal, audio and music analysis, articulating audio and symbolic approaches.\r\n\r\nThis framework is a continuation of the [_MIRtoolbox_]() project, going further into the design of an innovative environment offering a large range of audio and music analysis tools that can be freely articulated via a highly adaptive syntactic layer on top of Matlab. The _MiningSuite_ is a substantial step forward for several reasons:\r\n- Audio and symbolic analyses are unified into a single framework.\r\n- Exhaustive pattern mining capabilities allow detailed motivic and metrical analyses.\r\n- The _MiningSuite_ features an innovative and integrative set of symbolic-based musicological tools.\r\n- The code and architecture has been entirely rebuilt, in order to foster computational efficiency, code readability, organisation and generality. The project has migrated to an open-source collaborative environment open to all contributors.\r\n\r\nA more complete description of the _MiningSuite_ can be found on [this page](https://github.com/olivierlar/miningsuite/wiki/MiningSuite).\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\n\r\nThe following release is available for download:\r\n\r\n- MiningSuite 0.8.1 (new alpha version): http://goo.gl/I1ADmJ\r\n- MiningSuite 0.8 (alpha version for ISMIR 2014 tutorial): http://goo.gl/tTM1Ae\r\n\r\n## _MiningSuite_ User's Manual\r\n\r\nThe whole user's manual will be made progressively available online on this site through a wiki environment. First pages to read are the following:\r\n  * [further description of the _MiningSuite_](https://github.com/olivierlar/miningsuite/wiki/MiningSuite)\r\n  * [how to install and use the _MiningSuite_](https://github.com/olivierlar/miningsuite/wiki/How-to-start-using-the-MiningSuite%3F)\r\n  * GuidedTour: Guided Tour showing the capabilities of the _MiningSuite_\r\n  * More wiki pages are accessible, from the sidebar at the right of this page.\r\n\r\n## Project development history\r\n\r\nThe first version 0.6 committed in the repository in January 2014 was a very limited sneak peek showing some of the capabilities of the framework.\r\nAlpha version 0.8 released at the end of October 2014.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
